🎓 Student Grade Evaluation Program (C Language)
📌 Description

This project contains three C programs that demonstrate different ways to evaluate and process student grades based on marks or letter input.

The programs showcase:

✅ Ternary Operator

✅ Switch Statement

✅ If-Else Conditional Statements

✅ Character Handling

✅ Basic Input/Output in C

📂 Programs Included
1️⃣ Grade Using Ternary Operator

This program:

Takes student marks as input.

Assigns a grade using nested ternary operators.

Displays the final grade.

🔹 Grade Criteria
Marks Range	Grade
90 – 100	A
80 – 89	B
70 – 79	C
60 – 69	D
50 – 59	E
Below 50	F
2️⃣ Grade Using Switch Statement

This program:

Takes marks as input.

Divides marks by 10.

Uses a switch statement to determine grade.

Displays grade along with performance message.

🔹 Logic Used
switch(marks / 10)


Example:

95 → 9 → Grade A

82 → 8 → Grade B

3️⃣ Grade Eligibility Using If-Else

This program:

Takes grade (A–F) as character input.

Accepts both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Displays eligibility message based on grade.

Example:

A / a → Excellent work

F / f → Please try next time

🛠 How to Compile and Run
Using GCC:
gcc filename.c -o output
./output


Example:

gcc grade.c -o grade
./grade

⚠ Recommended Improvements

To make the programs more robust:

Add input validation (marks between 0–100).

Handle invalid character inputs.

Improve message formatting.

Combine all three programs into a menu-driven system.

📚 Concepts Practiced

Data Types (int, char)

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Ternary Operator (? :)

Switch Statement

Logical Operators (||)

User Input (scanf)

Output Formatting (printf)

🎯 Learning Objective

This project helps beginners understand:

Multiple ways to solve the same problem in C

Logical flow control

Clean decision-making structures

Basic program structure in C
